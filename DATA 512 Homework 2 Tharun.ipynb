ORES is a machine learning tool that can provide estimates of Wikipedia article quality.

You can use the API:Info request to get a range of metadata on an article, including the most current revision ID of the article page.\n","Putting this together, to get a Wikipedia page quality prediction from ORES for each politician’s article page you will need to: a) read each line of politicians_by_country.SEPT.2022.csv, b) make a page info request to get the current page revision, and c) make an ORES request using the page title and current revision id.\n","\n","The homework folder contains example code in notebooks to illustrate making a page info request and making an ORES request. This sample code is licensed CC0 so feel free to reuse any of the code in either notebook without attribution.\n","Note: It is possible that you will be unable to get a score for a particular article. If that happens, make sure to maintain a log of articles for which you were not able to retrieve an ORES score. This log can be saved as a separate file, or (if it's only a few articles), simply printed and logged within the notebook.
